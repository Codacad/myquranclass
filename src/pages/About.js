          <h2>My Journey:</h2>
          <p>
            My own journey in the pursuit of Islamic knowledge began with a deep
            curiosity and a thirst for spiritual understanding. Over the years,
            guided by the grace of Allah, I have had the privilege of studying
            under esteemed scholars and teachers. These experiences not only
            enriched my understanding of Islam but also ignited a passion within
            me to share this divine wisdom with others.
